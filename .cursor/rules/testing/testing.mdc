## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Runner: **Vitest**
- Location: `tests/*`
- Test utilities: `tests/utils/testUtils.ts`
- Factories/mocks under `tests/factories` and `tests/mocks`
- Accessibility: **Axe** via `jest-axe`/`vitest-axe`

### E2E Tests

- Runner: **Playwright**
- Location: `e2e/*`
- Critical flows only (smoke tests and key journeys)
- Accessibility: **axe-core** integration with Playwright where feasible

### Patterns

- Prefer testing domain logic in isolation from UI
- Mock API in services; do not hit real network in unit tests
- Keep tests fast and deterministic

### Audits in CI/CD

- **Lighthouse**: run periodically in CI for performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices
