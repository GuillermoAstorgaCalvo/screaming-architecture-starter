## Folder Structure: Index

This rule is an index that links to focused, composable rules under 500 lines each. Use these for precise guidance and reuse.

### What you likely want

- Root repo and `src/app` composition: `architecture/folder-structure-root-app.mdc`
- `src/core` (config, ports, utils, UI primitives, tokens, animation): `architecture/folder-structure-core-ui.mdc`
- `src/domains` and `src/shared` (anatomy, state, i18n): `architecture/folder-structure-domains-shared.mdc`
- Infrastructure, workers, assets, styles: `architecture/folder-structure-infra-platform.mdc`
- Types, tests, e2e, scripts, storybook, public, SEO, CI/CD: `architecture/folder-structure-ops-testing.mdc`

### Allowed Imports and Boundaries

See `boundaries.mdc` for the authoritative Allowed Imports matrix, path aliases, ESLint enforcement, and no-barrels policy.

### Runtime Configuration

### UI, Tokens, and A11y

See `ux/ui-design.mdc`, `ux/theming-tokens.mdc`, and `ux/accessibility.mdc` for design system usage and accessibility requirements.

### Performance and Budgets

See `ux/performance.mdc` and `ux/performance-budgets.mdc` for bundling, code splitting, and asset policies.

### Testing and Release
