## State Management

### Guidelines

- Keep state as close to where it is used as possible.
- Use Zustand per domain for cross-component state.
- Use React Query for server state (caching, retries, syncing).

### Stores

- Domain store in `domains/<domain>/store/*`.
- Avoid global mega-stores; keep concerns localized.

### Server State

- Query client provided via `app/providers/QueryProvider.tsx`.
- Domain services define queries/mutations wrapping `core/lib/httpClient`.
