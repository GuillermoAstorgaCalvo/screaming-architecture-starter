## Template Variants (Small → Medium → Large)

Scale the same architecture by choosing the minimal viable set of capabilities.

### Small (Landing / Marketing)

- Domains: one domain (e.g., `landing`)
- Providers: Theme only
- Testing: unit tests for critical components
- Performance: strict budgets, route-level splitting minimal
- Optional: E2E smoke, analytics noop

### Medium (Authenticated SPA)

- Multiple domains; `domains/shared/*` for cross-domain features
- Providers: Theme, Query, Auth; Analytics optional
- Forms abstraction with Zod
- Testing: unit + selective E2E for key flows
- Observability: optional error tracking adapter

### Large (Complex, Multi-domain)

- Strong domain boundaries; avoid coupling to infra
- Providers: Theme, Query, Auth, Analytics
- Observability: error tracking + Web Vitals adapters
- Storybook for shared/core UI
- E2E for critical journeys; Lighthouse in CI periodically
- PWA only if offline/install needed

### Migration Notes

- Promote shared features to `domains/shared/*` when reused 2+ times
- Keep `core` framework-agnostic to allow future SSR/SSG adoption
- Avoid barrels to preserve traceability across growth stages
