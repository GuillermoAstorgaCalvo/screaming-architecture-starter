## Scaffolding & Generators (scripts/generate.ts)

### Purpose

Create consistent domains, pages, components, and tests following the screaming-architecture boundaries.

### Suggested Generators

- `domain`: scaffolds `src/domains/<name>/` with pages, components, hooks, models, services, store, i18n
- `page`: adds a new page inside a domain and wires route into `<domain>/routes.ts`
- `component`: adds a domain component (optionally with story and test)

### Domain Structure Output

```
src/domains/<name>/
  routes.ts
  i18n/en.json
  pages/<Name>Page.tsx
  components/sections/
  components/widgets/
  hooks/use<Name>.ts
  models/<name>.ts
  services/<name>Service.ts
  store/<name>Store.ts
  constants.ts
```

### Rules

- Respect boundaries: no imports from `infrastructure` in domain templates
- Use alias imports in templates (`@domains/<name>/...`)
- Include minimal tests and story (optional) with placeholders

### Post-Generation Tasks

- Register domain routes in `src/app/router.tsx`
- Add translations and i18n keys
- Update tests where applicable
