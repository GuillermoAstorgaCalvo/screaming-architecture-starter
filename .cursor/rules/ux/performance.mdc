## Performance & Bundling

### Recommendations

- Route-based code splitting; lazy load heavy pages and widgets.
- Avoid heavy libs in core UI; prefer lightweight, tree-shakeable dependencies.
- Use modern image formats (WebP/AVIF); serve responsive sizes.

### Observability

- ✅ Web Vitals reporting via `core/perf/reportWebVitals.ts`. Tracks and reports Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB). Only runs in production mode. Uses logger adapter for reporting (can be extended to analytics services). Called in `main.tsx` during app bootstrap. Optional adapter can be added under `infrastructure/observability/*` for external analytics services.
