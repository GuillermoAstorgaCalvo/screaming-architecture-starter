## Performance & Bundling

### Recommendations

- Route-based code splitting; lazy load heavy pages and widgets.
- Avoid heavy libs in core UI; prefer lightweight, tree-shakeable dependencies.
- Use modern image formats (WebP/AVIF); serve responsive sizes.

### Observability

- Optional Web Vitals via `core/perf/reportWebVitals.ts` with an adapter under `infrastructure/observability/*`.
