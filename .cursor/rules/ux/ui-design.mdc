## UI, Design Tokens, and TailwindCSS

### Tokens

- Define tokens in `core/constants/designTokens.ts` (colors, spacing, radius, shadows).
- Mirror in `tailwind.config.ts` for class usage.

### Components

- Atomic UI in `core/ui/*` (Button, Input, Modal, Text, Heading, Icon).
- Domain-specific UI in `domains/<domain>/components/*`.

### Patterns

- Prefer composition over variants explosion.
- Extract repeated class patterns into components or utilities.
- Use responsive and dark mode classes consistently.
