## Accessibility (a11y)

### Guidelines

- Keyboard accessible interactive elements; visible focus states.
- Prefer semantic HTML; ensure color contrast; respect reduced-motion.
- Provide aria-labels/roles only when semantics are insufficient.

### Requirements

- Meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA for new work; AAA where low effort and high value.
- Preserve focus order and logical heading structure (`h1` → `h2` → ...).
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content (alt text; avoid redundant alt).
- Use landmark regions (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`) for structure.
- Ensure interactive targets are large enough (44x44 CSS px target guidance).
- Respect user preferences: `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-color-scheme`.

### Components

- Core UI should expose keyboard interactions and ARIA as needed (atoms first).
- Avoid role/pattern re-implementation when native semantics exist (e.g., `<button>` over clickable `<div>`).
- Manage focus on open/close of overlays and modals; trap focus when appropriate.

### Testing

- Include axe checks in unit tests for critical components/pages.
- Consider E2E axe checks for key flows where feasible.

#### Tooling & Process

- Unit: `jest-axe`/`vitest-axe` on rendered components (happy-path + variants).
- E2E: Playwright with `axe-core` on critical pages and flows.
- Manual: keyboard-only traversal; screen reader smoke (NVDA/VoiceOver) for forms and navigation.

#### Common Assertions

- No axe violations of serious/critical severity in PRs.
- All interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard.
- Visible focus ring and non-color-only states (hover/active/selected) where relevant.
- Color contrast AA (use design tokens and verify via tooling).

### Content & i18n

- Use concise, descriptive labels and headings; avoid placeholder-only labels.
- Ensure language attributes and i18n messages are meaningful and localized.

### Documentation

- Document known exceptions with rationale and compensating controls.
- Track a11y issues with priority labels; include repro steps and screenshots.
