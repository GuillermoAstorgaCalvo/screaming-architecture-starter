## Contributing Guide

> For module boundaries defer to `boundaries.mdc`. For baseline configs defer to `repo-templates.mdc`.

### Workflow

1. Create a branch from `develop`.
2. Implement changes following folder boundaries and conventions.
3. Add tests and update docs.
4. Open a PR to `develop` with clear description and checklist.
5. Maintainers will periodically create `release/*` branches from `develop` and PR them to `main`.
6. Urgent fixes go via `hotfix/*` from `main`, then back-merge to `develop`.

### Branching Model

- `main`: production-ready, tagged releases only. Protected.
- `develop`: integration branch for next release. Protected.
- `feature/<scope>`: new features; branch from `develop`; PR → `develop`.
- `fix/<scope>`: non-urgent bug fixes; branch from `develop`; PR → `develop`.
- `chore/<scope>`: tooling, deps, maintenance; PR → `develop`.
- `release/<version>`: stabilization; branch from `develop`; PR → `main` and back to `develop`.
- `hotfix/<version>`: critical production fix; branch from `main`; PR → `main` and back to `develop`.

### PR Targets

- Feature/fix/chore → `develop`
- Release → `main` (and then merge back to `develop`)
- Hotfix → `main` (and then merge back to `develop`)

### Merge Strategy

- Prefer squash merge for feature/fix/chore PRs.
- Keep `release/*` and `hotfix/*` history explicit (no squash) if changelog relies on it.
- Keep branches up to date by rebasing on `develop` before merge to avoid noisy merges.

### Protections & CI

- See `ci-cd.mdc` and `release-hygiene.mdc` for authoritative CI gates, branch protections, and release expectations.

### Coding Standards

- Follow `conventions.mdc` for naming, React/TypeScript patterns, and testing guidance.
- Follow `boundaries.mdc` for allowed imports, alias usage, and the no-barrels policy.
- Use baseline configs and versions from `repo-templates.mdc`.

### Commits

- Conventional commits recommended (feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, test).
  - Example: `feat(auth): add refresh token rotation`
  - Example: `fix(landing): correct hero image alt text`

### Versioning & Releases

- Semantic Versioning (SemVer): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Tag releases on `main` via `release/*` merges.
- Changelog generated from conventional commits when available.
