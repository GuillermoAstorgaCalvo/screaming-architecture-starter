## CI/CD Readiness

### Required (recommended)

- Typecheck, lint, unit tests, build on PRs to protected branches.
- Enforce ESLint boundaries and alias usage.

### Optional

- E2E on main/nightly; Lighthouse audits periodically.
- Pre-commit hooks (lint-staged + Prettier) and conventional commits.
- Visual regression testing (e.g., Chromatic) for UI scalability.
